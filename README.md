# HGR Tool #

This is an image editor for Apple II hi-res graphics.  It operates on saved
screens, which are about 8KB in size.  The tool is written as a single-page
web application, so you don't need to download anything to use it.  It runs
entirely in the local browser, with no server components or cookies.

You can launch the tool by going to https://hgrtool.art/, or (if domain names
are being weird) https://fadden.github.io/HGRTool.

A brief [demo video](https://youtu.be/Cr55oV_MjX4) is also available.

This is not meant to be the future of graphics editing.  This is primarily a
vehicle for me to play with JavaScript+HTML+CSS.
